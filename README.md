# DSA103_DataProject_RW
Data Project on " Leaf metabolic traits reveal hidden dimensions of plant form and function" for DSA103

In this project, I replicated the [derive_chemistry.R](scripts/derive_chemistry.R) workflow using Python, applying it to the dataset [mtbs_tropical_annotations.tsv](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.zpc866tdn). This dataset originates from [Walker et al (2023)](<data/Walker et al. - 2023 - Leaf metabolic traits reveal hidden dimensions of plant form and function.pdf>),“Leaf metabolic traits reveal hidden dimensions of plant form and function.”
The full step-by-step implementation is documented in the Jupyter notebook [derive_chemistry.ipynb](/Users/riccarda/Desktop/DSA103_DataProject_RW/scripts/derive_chemistry.ipyn).
Using the resulting output file [classifier_pathway.csv](scripts/classifier_pathway.csv), I then performed a principal component analysis (PCA) to explore how chemical descriptors distribute across metabolic pathway classes, which can also be followed in my [PCA.ipynb](scripts/PCA.ipynb)
